The word al-ilm here, and in general if it is stated in quran and hadits, 
refers to the islamic knowledge or shariah knowledge.
For other kinds of knowledge, it is also a must if they:
* help the diin, 
* help people in doing ibadah to Allah, 

To begin with, 
The virtue of islamic knowledge: it is something that you inherit from the prophet
* knowledge is a sign that Allah loves us; if Allah loves you than Allah will drive you to study the knowledge
* knowledge is something eternal,
* knowledge is something that keeps you, in contrast wealth is something that you have to keep
* actions that are aimed to get knowledge will ease the way to the jannah
* Allah will respect more people who have iman and knowledge

Eternal things:
* sodaqoh jariyah; scholarship to study, paying people to study 
* knowledge that is used by people; people can take benefit from the knowledge
* good/shaleh children that make doa

Kinds of islamic knowledge that needs to be studied:
* the knowledge by which we can perform ibadah to Allah, e.g. about wudu, fasting, zakat (only for the one who has an amount of wealth for which a zakat should be spent)
* muamalah, e.g. how the rule about marriage (fardu ain for people who want to marry)

Hasad (iri) is wanting to have something like someone; to be like someone.
Two things that are allowed to be hasad:
* rich people who spend it in the way of Allah
* knowledgeable people who use the knowledge, and teach the knowledge

the standard of knowledgeable people:
people who have knowledge are indicated by how scared (fear) they are to Allah;
Al fathir: 28
