* the greatest (the essence) surah of the entire Quran: Al-Fatihah (7 ayats)

* In prayer, Al-Fatihah is always paired with another surah
* Reciting Al-Fatihah can be a source of healing
* Allah responses for every single ayah recited of Al-Fatihah
* contains:
  * knowledge of God (who Allah is)
  * action: I am ready to worship Allah
  * merge knowledge and action: (guide us to) the straight path
