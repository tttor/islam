### [30: Al-'Asr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JL09VjJQWE): 
* time is the biggest asset you have
  * the biggest lost we have is time, so respect time
  * keep yourself productive, free time destroys most people
* the only people who are not going to lose out are people who believe,
  * who do a few handful of good deeds that Allah asked them to do
  * who encourage, enjoin, counsel, remind, advise each other
  * equally concerned
* find good company to keep your faith alive
* sabr is also for temptation, distraction, not only for difficulties
* take care for Salah first
  * it is the ultimate reminder of the value of time
  * go to mosque, specially for Fajr and Isya
