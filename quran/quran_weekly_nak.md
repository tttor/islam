* take Allah's Commands Seriously
* time-invariant problem: 
  * people's reaction on instructions **clearly from Allah**: 
    are you kidding me? No way, it does not make any sense, 
    which is a mockery out of Allah commandments
  * for those who carry the message of Islam and give advice for the sake of Allah, 
    they should seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant, 
    do not lose the control and temper
 * never make fun of Allah's commandments
 * when they do give advice and hear inappropriate things should control their emotion and temper

* He remains the bigger priority even after Ramadhan

* Understanding Trials & Difficulties
* Allah does not burden any individual except to that person's capacity
* any trial, hardhip is customed, tailor to individual capacity
* no excure on obligatory commands, though, e.g. staying away form haram
* a person will benefit whatever they earn
* do not overestimate the burden that Allah has put on you in terms of responsibility
* do not underestimate the weight of sin

### [30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JL09VjJQWE): [Al-'Asr](https://quran.com/103)
* time is the biggest asset you have
  * the biggest lost we have is time, so respect time
  * keep yourself productive, free time destroys most people
* the only people who are not going to lose out are people who believe,
  * who do a few handful of good deeds that Allah asked them to do
  * who encourage, enjoin, counsel, remind, advise each other
  * equally concerned
* find good company to keep your faith alive
* sabr is also for temptation, distraction, not only for difficulties
* take care for Salah first
  * it is the ultimate reminder of the value of time
  * go to mosque, specially for Fajr and Isya
